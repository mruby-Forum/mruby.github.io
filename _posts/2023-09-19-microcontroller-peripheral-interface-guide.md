# Common I/O API Guidelines for mruby and mruby/c

Common I/O API Guidelines for mruby and [mruby/c](https://github.com/mrubyc/mrubyc) have been established and released.

We have established the Common I/O API Guidelines(hereinafter referred to as "Guidelines") for mruby and mruby/c. This initiative enhances the portability of programs across different microcontrollers (hereinafter referred to as "MCUs") and improves the reusability of various sensors and I/O control libraries. When utilizing mruby and mruby/c in the future, we sincerely hope that you will refer to these Guidelines.

Additionally, we would like to introduce libraries developed by enthusiastic contributors for MCUs that have been made available. If there are MCU libraries not listed below and you have created your own, we encourage you to inform us through the inquiry so that we can include it in our introductions.
